This mod allows you to customize the "gender" of clothing you receive from tailoring and the Desert Festival makeover stall. In the vanilla game, some tailoring recipes will give you either a male or female version of the clothing item based on your farmer's gender/body-type. And during the Desert Festival makeover, some outfits are only obtainable to female farmers, and some only to male farmers. This mod seeks to make Stardew Valley more friendly to trans and gender non-conforming players (as well as anyone else who would benefit) by providing more control over the clothing players receive in-game.

# How to use

To change your clothing preferences, you can either use the in-game menu provided by Generic Mod Config Menu (recommended), or you can manually edit the `config.json` file that will appear in this mod's folder after the game has been launched (note: if you choose to edit the config menu, the game will have to be reopened for the changes to take effect). The mod has two settings: Clothing Style and Makeover Outfit Style.

### Clothing Style
This refers to the "gender" or style of clothing you get from certain tailoring recipes. Some recipes have both masculine and feminine versions, so this setting allows you to choose which version you'll get, regardless of your farmer's gender/body type. There are 4 options for this setting: Default, Masculine, Feminine, and Random.

- **Default:** This uses your farmer's in-game gender/body type to determine which clothing versions to give you, just like the vanilla game. If your farmer is male (or body type 1, if using the [Gender Neutrality Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/722)), you will receive the masculine versions, and if your farmer is female (body type 2), you will receive the feminine versions.
- **Masculine:** If this option is selected, you will receive the masculine version of tailoring recipes, regardless of your gender/body type.
- **Feminine:** If this option is selected, you will receive the feminine version of tailoring recipes, regardless of your gender/body type.
- **Random:** When tailoring, you could receive either the feminine or masculine version of the item, randomly selected each time you craft it.

### Makeover Outfit Style
Outfits that you can receive from Emily's makeover stand at the Desert Festival are classed in-game as male, female, or neutral. In the vanilla game, if your farmer is male, you can only receive male or neutral outfits, and vice versa. This setting lets you change that with 5 options: Default, Masculine, Feminine, Any, and Neutral Only.

- **Default:** Similar to the Clothing Style option, this makes no changes to how the makeover outfits work.
- **Masculine:** You will only get outfits typically available to a male farmer, i.e., outfits that are either masculine or neutral.
- **Feminine:** You will only get outfits typically available to a female farmer, i.e., outfits that are either feminine or neutral.
- **Any:** You could get any of the makeover outfits: masculine, feminine, or neutral.
- **Neutral:** You will only get outfits classed as neutral.
